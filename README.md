The Customer Experience:

Welcome to C$50 Deals! The easiest way to get discounts at the restaurants and
stores you love.

Upon reaching cs50deals.com, you will be prompted to log in with your username 
and password. If you do not already have an account, you can click register,
and you will be taken to another form to input your username, password, and
phone number. Note: the username and phone number fields must be unique, so
don't try to sign up multiple times to try to get multiple deals.

Once you are in the site, you can input (or update) your preferences under the
"Change Preferences" tab. Click one of the 3 boxes ("Food", "Other", or "Surprise
Me") and then "Gimme dem dealz" to submit your preferences and be officially
welcomed to the site. This choice will determine which type of deals you are
texted.

If you need to change your password, simply click "Change Password," and
a short form will appear allowing you to input your old and new passwords.

Lastly, to log out, you simply hit the "Log Out" tab, and you will be taken back
to the login page, and will need to re-login if you want to access the site again.



The Vendor Experience:

Welcome to C$50 Deals! The easiest way to send discounts to customers.

Upon reaching cs50deals.com, you will be prompted to log in. Vendors should click
the vendor sign in or register links, input their user name and password (and
company name and a confirmation password for register). Note: the username field
must be unique, but not the company name, so multiple workers can have accounts.

Once you are in the site, you can input your deal under the
"Send Deals" tab. Simply input the deal, making sure to include the discount
amount as well as your company name and the length of the promotion, and click
one of the 3 boxes ("Food", "Other", or "Surprise Me") corresponding to the type
of deal. Once you hit "Send me customers!" the site will send text messages to
all the customers who have signed up for that type of deal, and a confirmation
page will appear telling you how many customers received the deal.

If you need to change your password, simply click "Change Password," and
a short form will appear allowing you to input your old and new passwords.

Lastly, to log out, you simply hit the "Log Out" tab, and you will be taken back
to the login page, and will need to re-login if you want to access the site again.
